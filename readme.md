# JavaScript Practice Questions


This repository contains a collection of JavaScript practice questions that I have solved. These questions cover various concepts and can be used to enhance your understanding of JavaScript programming.

 # About

In this repository, you will find 30 JavaScript questions that I have solved. Each question is accompanied by its corresponding solution, written in JavaScript. These questions are designed to cover a wide range of topics, including:

1. Variables and data types
2. Control flow and loops
3. Functions and scope
4. Arrays and objects
5. DOM manipulation



Feel free to explore the questions and solutions provided here. 



Each question file contains the prompt or description of the problem, while the corresponding solution file provides an implementation of the solution. You can find the questions in the questions/ directory and their respective solutions in the solutions/ directory.


## DOM Assignments

The `DOM Assignments` section includes 9 assignments that focus on practicing DOM manipulation using JavaScript. Each assignment is organized in its own folder, containing the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Within each assignment folder, you will find a detailed README file that explains the requirements and my approach to solving the task. By completing these assignments, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in working with the DOM, manipulating elements, handling events, and creating dynamic web pages.
